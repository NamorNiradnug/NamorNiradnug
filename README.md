### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I don't code much and I am not a pro (at least yet). My favorite programming language is [Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim).
Also see my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/NamorNiradnug/.dotfiles) if you want to know what stuff I use for programming (I use ~~Garuda~~ arch btw).

#### Things I want to do (preferrably this year):

- [ ] Other widgets I would like to use in wf-shell:
    - [ ] Better connections widget
    - [ ] Bluetooth widget
    - [ ] Dynamically loaded widgets (that's difficult to implement)
- [ ] Screenlocker/-saver for wayland (sceenlocker with a dynamic background)
